I wish I was in the land of cotton; 
Old time dar am not forgotten. 
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie land. In Dixie Land whar' I was born in, 
Early on one frosty morn-in', 
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie land. 
CHORUS
Den I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray! In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand 
To lib an' die in Dixie; 
Away, Away, Away down south in Dixie; Away, Away, Away down south in Dixie. 

Old Missus marry Will, de weaber; 
Willium was a gay deceaber. 
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie land. But when he put his arm around'er, 
He smil'd as fierce as a forty pounder. Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie land. 
CHORUS 
His face was sharp as a butcher's cleaber, But that did not seem to greab her. 
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie land. Old Missus acted the foolish part, 
And died for a man dat broke her heart. Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie land. 
CHORUS
