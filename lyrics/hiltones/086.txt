CHORUS
Today while the blossoms still cling to the vine,
I'll taste your strawberries,
I'll drink your sweet wine.
A million tomorrows shall all pass away
Ere I forget all the joy that is mine today.

Well, I'll be a rambler and I'll be a rover
You'll know who I am by the song that I sing.
I'll eat at your table,
I'll sleep in your clover,
Who cares what the morrow may bring.
CHORUS
I can't be contented with yesterday's story,
I can't live on promises winter to spring,
Today is my moment and now is my story,
I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing!
CHORUS
