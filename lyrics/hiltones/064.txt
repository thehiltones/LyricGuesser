Well I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had-a-one long horn and one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said oo-wee
It looked like a purple people eater to me
CHORUS
It was a one-eyed, one-horned flying
purple people eater.
A one-eyed, one-horned flying
purple people eater.
A one-eyed, one-horned flying
purple people eater.
Sure looked strange to me.

Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree.
I said, "Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me!"
I heard him say in a voice so gruff.
"I wouldn't eat you 'cause your so tough."
CHORUS
I said, "Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line?"
He said, "Eatin' purple people and it sure is fine;
But that's not the reason that I came to land:
I wanna get a job in a rock-n-roll band."

Well, Bless my soul, rock-n-roll flying Purple People Eater
Pigeon-toed, under code, flying Purple People Eater.
He wears short-shorts friendly little People Eater
What a sight to see.

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground,
And he started to rock a-really rockin' around.
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune.
Sing a bop-bop a boomp-a-lop a lum-bam-boon.
Bless my soul, rock-n-roll, flying Purple People Eater.
Pigeon-toed, under code, flying Purple People Eater.
I like short-shorts flying Purple People Eater,
What a sight to see.

Well he went on his way and then a-what do you know
I saw him last night on a TV show.
He was blowin' it out a-really knockin' 'em dead
Playing rock-n-roll music through the
horn in his head.
CHORUS
