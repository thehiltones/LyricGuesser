When Joseph Went to Bethlehem

When Joseph went to Bethlehem,
I think he took great care,
To place his tools and close his shop and
Leave no shavings there.
He urged the donkey forward then,
With Mary on its back,
And carried bread and goat cheese
In a little linen sack.

I think there at the busy inn
That he was meek and mild.
And awed to be the guardian
Of Mary’s sacred child.
Perhaps all through the chilly hours
He smoothed the swaddling bands,
And Jesus felt the quiet strength
Of Joseph’s gentle hands.

And close beside the manger bed,
He dimmed the lantern’s light
And held the little Jesus close
Upon that holy night.
