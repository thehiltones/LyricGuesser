The Church in The Wildwood

There's a church in the valley  By the wildwood  
No lovelier place in the dale;  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  As the little brown church in the vale.  
CHORUS  
Oh come, come, come, come, come  To the church in the wildwood;  Oh come to the church in the dale.  No spot is so dear to my childhood  As the little brown church  
in the vale.  

How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning  To list to the clear ringing bell;  Its tones so sweetly are calling;  "Oh, come to the church in the  vale."  
CHORUS 
There close by the church in the valley.  Lies one that I loved so well;  
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps,  
'neath the willows;  
Disturb not her rest in the vale.  CHORUS  
There, close by the side of that  loved one,  
'Neath the trees where the wild  flowers bloom,  
When farewell hymn shall be chanted,  I shall rest by her side in the  
tomb.  
CHORUS
