        "Book of Mormon stories that my teacher tells to me\u00a0 Are about the Lamanites in ancient history.",
        "Long ago their fathers came from far across the sea,\u00a0 Giv\u2019n the land if they lived righteously.",
        "",
        "Lamanites met others who were seeking liberty,\u00a0 And the land soon welcomed all who wanted to be free.\u00a0 Book of Mormon stories say that we must brothers be,\u00a0 Giv\u2019n the land if we live righteously.",
        "",
        "Alma was rebellious, and he fought against the right.\u00a0 Then one day an angel came to turn him to the light.\u00a0 Struck before his brethren, Alma learned humility.\u00a0 Then he taught in the land righteously.",
        "",
        "Don\u2019t forget Abinadi, who stood before the king.\u00a0 All chained up from head to toe, the gospel he did bring.\u00a0 If he would deny it, then the king would set him free.\u00a0 He was true, and he died righteously.",
        "",
        "Ammon was a missionary serving Lamanites,\u00a0 Tending King Lamoni\u2019s sheep for several days and nights.",
        "Robbers came; he saved the sheep by fighting fearlessly.\u00a0 He had learned he could live righteously.",
        "",
        "Once two thousand sons of God were called to fight the foe.\u00a0 Marching as an army into battle they did go.",
        "They believed that Christ the Lord their guardian would be.\u00a0 They had learned they should live righteously.",
        "",
        "Samuel the Lamanite, high on the city wall,",
        "Came to warn the people, and repentance was his call.\u00a0 Arrows could not hit him, for a man of God was he,\u00a0 And he taught in the land righteously.",
        "",
        "After Christ was crucified and died for you and me,\u00a0 He came forth to teach the truth to all who would be free.\u00a0 Hands were laid upon each child. He blessed them tenderly,\u00a0 And they lived in the land righteously."
