        "CHORUS",
        "Oh, Mr. Mr. Jonathan Beck",
        "How could you be so mean.",
        "I told you you'd be sorry",
        "For inventing that machine.",
        "Now all the neighbor\u2019s cats and dogs\u00a0 Will never more be seen.",
        "They'll all be ground to sausages\u00a0 In Jonathan Beck's machine.",
        "",
        "One day a little Dutch boy",
        "Came walking up the street.",
        "He bought a pound of sausages\u00a0 And laid them at his feet.",
        "Then he began to whistle",
        "And whistled up a tune.",
        "And all the little sausages",
        "Danced around the room.",
        "CHORUS",
        "One day the machine was broken;\u00a0 The thing just wouldn't go.",
        "So, Jonathan Beck he crawled inside\u00a0 To see what made it so.",
        "His wife was having a nightmare\u00a0 And walking in her sleep.",
        "She gave the crank a terrible yank\u00a0 And Jonathan Beck was meat.",
        "CHORUS"
