CHORUS 
Oh, Mr. Mr. Jonathan Beck  
How could you be so mean. 
I told you you'd be sorry  
For inventing that machine. 
Now all the neighbor’s cats and dogs  Will never more be seen. 
They'll all be ground to sausages  In Jonathan Beck's machine. 

One day a little Dutch boy  
Came walking up the street. 
He bought a pound of sausages  And laid them at his feet.
Then he began to whistle  
And whistled up a tune. 
And all the little sausages  
Danced around the room. 
CHORUS  
One day the machine was broken;  The thing just wouldn't go. 
So, Jonathan Beck he crawled inside  To see what made it so. 
His wife was having a nightmare  And walking in her sleep. 
She gave the crank a terrible yank  And Jonathan Beck was meat.
