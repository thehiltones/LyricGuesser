        "It rolled off the table,\u00a0 And onto the floor.",
        "And then my poor meatball,\u00a0 Rolled out of the door.",
        "",
        "It rolled in the garden,\u00a0 And under a bush.",
        "And then my poor meatball,\u00a0 Was nothing but mush.",
        "",
        "The mush was as tasty,\u00a0 As tasty could be.",
        "And then my poor meatball,\u00a0 Grew into a tree.",
        "The tree was all covered,\u00a0 With fine tasty moss.\u00a0 With good tasty meatballs,\u00a0 And tomato sauce.",
        "",
        "So if you eat spaghetti,\u00a0 All covered with cheese,\u00a0 Hold on to your meatball,\u00a0 And don't ever sneeze."
