Star Bright

The heavens with light o'er-flowing
A story of love will tell;
And angels will sing of glory
When Jesus comes on earth to dwell.
CHORUS
Oh, star bright the world is pining
For you to turn night into day;
Oh, star bright in heaven shining
Come glow within me on Christmas day.

Be joyful with eyes up turning,
Beholding the time at hand;
The night sign will soon be burning,
He's coming to our promised land.
CHORUS
Our Father, in love is sending
His Christ-child to conquer strife;
Prepare ye! Repent of sinning!
He's bringing everlasting life.
CHORUS
