Everybody’s Rich but Us

There's not much hair on an apple  
There's very little fuzz on a grape.  
It's only the lack of a beard on a peach  That keeps it from being an ape.  

Oh, one more time around Piccadilly Circus  Driver, follow that bus.  
It's a shame the way the rich folk work us.  Everybody's rich but us.  

I bought my doggie a muzzle  
So he wouldn't bite the man with the mail.  But there was the mailman dead on the walk.  He'd killed him with his tail.  

Oh, one more time around Gooseberry Junction  Driver, follow that bus.  
It's rather hard for us to function  
Everybody's rich but us....  

Oh, one more time around Buckingham Palace  Driver, follow that bus.  
There's a blister growin' on my callus.  Everybody's rich but us.
