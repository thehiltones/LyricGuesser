        "Little Willie Green had a brand-new kiddie car, And he took some cutie riding every day. He'd meet them, and greet them,",
        "To a spin he'd treat them.",
        "They'd ride a while and then he'd stop and say.",
        "",
        "\"Come on and kiss me, or ya got to get out. Get out of my kiddie car.\"",
        "That's all that Willie Green said.",
        "When we went for a spin,",
        "I kept on crying \"No, No!\"",
        "But he'd only grin and holler",
        "\"Kiss me, or ya gotta get out!\"",
        "",
        "Then I thought of one girlie that I knew. She had to walk so far",
        "That she got blisters on her feet.",
        "And then her papa spanked her",
        "On the corner of the street.",
        "And he said, \"Kiss me, or ya gotta get out\" So, I kissed him, what else could I do!"
