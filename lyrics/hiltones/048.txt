Little Boxes

Little boxes on the hillside,  
Little boxes made of ticky-tacky, Little boxes, little boxes,  
Little boxes all the same. 
CHORUS
There's a green one and a pink one  And a blue one and a yellow one And they're all made out of tikki taki And they all look just the same. 

And the people in the houses  
All go to the university 
And they all get put in boxes  
Little boxes all the same. 

And there's doctors and there's lawyers,  And business executives 
And they're all made out of tikki taki And they all look just the same.

And they all play on the Golf Course And drink their martini dry 
And they all have pretty children And the children go to school. 

And the children go to summer camp And then to the university 
And they get put in boxes 
And they all come out the same. 

And the boys go into business And marry and raise a family And they all get put in boxes Little boxes all the same. 
CHORUS
