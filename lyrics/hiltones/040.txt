I’ve Got Sixpence  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0jxb18ZwoY&list=PLL1_UHbUZR_xXBr2EBs9IOfygINJGnoMB&index=40I've got sixpence, jolly, jolly sixpence. I've got sixpence to last me all my life, I've two pence to spend and 
Two pence to lend and 
Two pence to send home to my wife, poor wife. 
CHORUS 
No cares have I to greet me. 
No pretty little girls to deceive me, 
I'm happy as a king believe me as we go rollin' rollin' home. 
Rollin' home, rollin' home, 
By the light of the silvery moon 
Happy is the day when a soldier gets his pay, And we go rollin' rollin' home. 

I've got four pence, jolly, jolly four pence. I've got four pence to last me all my life, I've got two pence to spend and 
Two pence to lend and 
No pence to send home to my wife, poor wife. CHORUS 
I've got three pence, jolly, jolly three pence. I've got three pence to last me all my life, I've got two pence to spend and 
One pence to lend and 
No pence to send home to my wife.
CHORUS  
I've got two pence, jolly, jolly two pence. I've got two pence to last me all my life, I've got two pence to spend and 
No pence to lend and  
No pence to send home to my wife, poor wife.  CHORUS  
I've got one pence, jolly, jolly one pence.  I've got one pence to last me all my life, I've got one pence to spend and 
No pence to lend and 
No pence to send home to my wife, poor wife.  CHORUS  
I've got no pence, jolly, jolly no pence.  I've got no pence to last me all my life, I've got no pence to spend and 
No pence to lend and 
No pence to send home to my wife... CHORUS
