I’ll Take A Leg

I'll take a leg from some old table 
I'll take an arm from some old chair 
I'll take a neck from some old bottle 
And from a horse, I'll get some hair, I'll get some hair. I'll put the whole darn mess together 
With the aid of string and glue 
And I'll get more lovin' from that 
Doggone dummy than I'll ever get from you. GET OUT AND WALK!
