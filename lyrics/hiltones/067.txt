Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,
Away you rolling river.
Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you.
Away, I'm bound away,
Across the wide Missouri.

I long to see your peaceful valley,
And hear that rolling river.
I long to see your peaceful valley,
Away, I'm bound away,
'Cross the wide Missouri.

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,
And see that rollin' river.
Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you.
Away, I'm bound away,
'Cross the wide Missouri.
