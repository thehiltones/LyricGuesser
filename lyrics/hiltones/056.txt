My Heavenly Father Loves Me

Whenever I hear the song of a bird  Or look at the blue, blue sky  
Whenever I feel the rain on my face  Or the wind as it rushes by.  

Whenever I touch a velvet rose  Or walk by a lilac tree  
I'm glad that I live in this beautiful world  Heavenly Father created for me.  

He gave me my eyes that I might see  The color of butterfly wings  
He gave me my ears that I might hear  The magical sound of things.  

He gave me my life, my mind, my heart  I thank him reverently  
For all his creations of which I'm apart  Yes, I know Heavenly Father loves me.
