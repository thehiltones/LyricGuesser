        "My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf.\u00a0 So, it stood ninety years on the floor.",
        "It was taller by half than the old man himself.\u00a0 Though it weighed not a penny weight more.\u00a0 It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born.\u00a0 And was always his treasure and pride;",
        "But it stopped, short, never to go again,",
        "When the old man died.",
        "CHORUS",
        "Ninety years without slumbering",
        "Tick-tock, tick-tock",
        "His life seconds numbering",
        "Tick-tock, tick-tock",
        "It stopped, short, never to go again,",
        "When the old man died.",
        "",
        "In watching its pendulum swing to and fro",
        "Many hours had he spent when a boy;",
        "And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know\u00a0 And to share both his grief and his joy.",
        "For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door\u00a0 With a blooming and beautiful bride.",
        "But it stopped, short, never to go again,",
        "When the old man died.",
        "CHORUS",
        "My grandfather said that of those he could hire\u00a0 Not a servant so faithful he found",
        "For it wasted no time and had but one desire.\u00a0 At the close of each week to be wound.",
        "And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face,\u00a0 And its hands never hung by its side.",
        "But it stopped, short, never to go again,",
        "When the old man died.",
        "CHORUS",
        "It rang an alarm, in the dead of the night",
        "An alarm that for years had been dumb.",
        "And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight,\u00a0 That his hour for departure had come.",
        "Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime,\u00a0 As we silently stood by his side;",
        "But it stopped, short, never to go again,",
        "When the old man died.",
        "CHORUS"
