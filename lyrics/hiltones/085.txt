Tired little curly head
Put his toys away
And as he tumbled into bed,
We could hear him say:

Thank you, Mommy, for tuckin' me in bed,
Thank you Daddy, for stories that you've read;
Thank you, Teddy bear, for always bein' there,
This is THANK YOU DAY.

Thank you, circus, for ev'ry funny clown,
Thank you, Santa, for always comin' 'roun',
Thank you, candy shops, for makin' lolly pops,
This is THANK YOU DAY.

And when I lay me down to sleep,
Ev'ry night I know,
Someone has my soul to keep,
I want to thank Him so.

Thank you, Winter, for ev'ry snowy day,
Thank you, Summer, for all the time to play.
Thank you family, for always lovin' me,
Let me thank you,
This is THANK YOU DAY.
