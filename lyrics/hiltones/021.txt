If you miss the train I'm on 
You will know that I am gone. 
You can hear the whistle blow, 500 miles. 
500 miles, 500 miles, 500 miles, 500 miles. 
You can hear the whistle blow, 500 miles. 

Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four. Lord I'm five hundred miles, away from home. Away from home, away from home,  
Away from home, away from home. 
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home. 

Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name. Lord I can't go back home this-away. 
This-away, this-away, this-away, this-away. Lord I can't go back home this-away.
