If I Had a Hammer

If I had a hammer 
I'd hammer in the morning 
I'd hammer in the evening 
All over this land. 
I'd hammer out danger 
I'd hammer out a warning 
I'd hammer out the love between  my brothers and my sisters. All over this land. 

Now I've got a hammer 
And I've got a bell 
And I've got a song to sing 
All over this land. 
It's the hammer of justice 
It's the bell of freedom 
It's the song about the love 
Between my brothers and my sisters All over this land.
