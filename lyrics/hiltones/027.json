        "Oh, give me a home,",
        "Where the buffalo roam.",
        "Where the deer and the antelope play. Where seldom is heard a discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day.",
        "CHORUS",
        "Home, home on the range,",
        "Where the deer and the antelope play. Where seldom is heard a discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day.",
        "",
        "How often at night",
        "Where the heavens are bright",
        "With the lights from the glittering stars Have I stood there amazed, asked as I gaze? If their glory exceeds that of ours.",
        "CHORUS",
        "Oh, give me a land,",
        "Where the bright diamond sand",
        "Flows leisurely down the stream.",
        "Where the graceful white swan",
        "goes gliding along",
        "Like a maid in a heavenly dream. CHORUS"
