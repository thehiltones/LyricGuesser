Your hair is the color of tomato soup  
April fool, April fool  
There's a great big gorilla in the chicken coop.  April, April fool.  
CHORUS  
Oh, look out the window, what d' ya see?  Peaches on a cherry tree!  
I fool you; you fool me.  
This is April Fool Day  

The cat's in the middle of the custard pie  April Fool, April Fool.  
There's a dog in the kitchen and he's ten feet high,  April Fool, April Fool.  
CHORUS  
The pig in the parlor has a big cigar,  
April Fool, April Fool.  
There's a two headed elephant in Daddy's car,  April, April Fool.  
CHORUS  
The cow in the clover gave the horse a kiss,  April Fool, April Fool,  
You can't ever sing a silly song like this,  'Cept on April Fool's Day  
April, April Fool.
