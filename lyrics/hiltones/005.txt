Army of Helaman

We have been born, as Nephi of old,  
To goodly parents who love the Lord.  We have been taught, and we understand,  That we must do as the Lord commands.  
CHORUS  
We are as the army of Helaman.  
We have been taught in our youth.  
And we will be the Lord’s missionaries  To bring the world his truth.  

We have been saved for these latter days  To build the kingdom in righteous ways.  We hear the words our prophet declares:  “Let each who’s worthy go forth and share.”  
CHORUS  
We know his plan, and we will prepare,  Increase our knowledge through study and prayer.  Daily we’ll learn until we are called  
To take the gospel to all the world.  
CHORUS  
To bring the world his truth.
