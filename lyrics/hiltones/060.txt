On Top of Spaghetti

On top of spaghetti,  
All covered with cheese.  I lost my poor meatball,  When somebody sneezed.  

It rolled off the table,  And onto the floor.  
And then my poor meatball,  Rolled out of the door.  

It rolled in the garden,  And under a bush.  
And then my poor meatball,  Was nothing but mush. 
 
The mush was as tasty,  As tasty could be.  
And then my poor meatball,  Grew into a tree.  
The tree was all covered,  With fine tasty moss.  With good tasty meatballs,  And tomato sauce.  

So if you eat spaghetti,  All covered with cheese,  Hold on to your meatball,  And don't ever sneeze.
