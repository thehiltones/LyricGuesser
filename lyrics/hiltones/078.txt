The bear went over the mountain,
The bear went over the mountain,
The bear went over the mountain,
To see what he could see.

To see what he could see,
To see what he could see,
The bear went over the mountain,
To see what he could see.

The other side of the mountain
The other side of the mountain
The other side of the mountain
Was all that he could see.

Was all that he could see
Was all that he could see
The other side of the mountain
Was all that he could see.
