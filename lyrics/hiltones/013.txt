When I was a little, bitty baby 
My mamma would rock me in the cradle, In them old cotton field back home. 
 
Well it was down in Louisiana, Just about a mile from Texarkana. In them old cotton field back home. 

Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten You can't pick very much cotton. In them old cotton fields back home.  

Well it was down in Louisiana, Just about a mile from Texarkana. In them old cotton fields back home.
