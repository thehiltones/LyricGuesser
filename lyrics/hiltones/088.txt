William Tell

Have you heard of a man named William Tell
This man was said to shoot so well,
He shot at the head of his only son,
No one thought it could be done.

But the lad didn't move cause he knew his dad,
Could surely hit the apple red.
That the tyrant had forced him to place
Upon his brave young son's small head.

Now his name will live on For a deed so bold.
Even though it's a legend I've been told.
But it's nice just to know that the tale ends well.
So three cheers for William Tell.
