Ghost Song  

Oo-oo-oo-oo, A haunting we will go. 

Said one little ghost to another little ghost, A haunting we will go, 
It's Halloween, you know, 
We'll scare the people so. 

Said two little ghosts to another little ghost, Oh, come and join the fun, 
We'll "boo" at ev'ry one, 
'Cause Halloween's begun. 

The three little ghosts got together And found a witch’s broom, Whee! It was neat to wear a sheet 
And fly through ev'rybody's room. 

They scared all the folks, 
With their very scary jokes 
And said, "We'll miss this so, 
Until next year, you know, 
When a haunting we will go! 
Oo-oo-oo-oo, A haunting we will go.
