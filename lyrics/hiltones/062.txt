Playmate

Playmate, come out and play with me,
And bring your dollies three,
Climb up my apple tree,
Holler down my rain barrel,
Slide down my cellar door,
And we'll be jolly friends, forever more.
Oh she couldn't come out and play,
It was a rainy day,

With tear filled eyes, she breathed a sigh
And I could hear her say.
I'm sorry playmate,
I cannot play with you.
My dolly has the flu,
Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
Ain't got no rain barrel,
Ain't got no cellar door,
But we'll be jolly friends,
Forever more!
