Won't You Be My Valentine

Won't you be my Valentine,
Valentine, Valentine.
Won't you be a pal of mine
on Valentine's day.
You can share my toys with me,
Bounce my ball, climb my tree.
If my Valentine you'll be,
On Valentine's day.

I won't ever tease you, or
Chase you down the street.
I'll give you candy Kisses,
That both of us can eat.
So won't you be my Valentine,
Valentine, Valentine.
Won't you be a pal of mine
on Valentine's day.
