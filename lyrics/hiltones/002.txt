All Through the Night

Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee  All thro' the night;  
Guardian angels God will send thee  All thro' the night.  
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping,  Hill and vale in slumber steeping,  I, my loving vigil keeping  
All thro' the night.  

Angels watching, e'er around thee,  All through the night  
Midnight slumber close surround thee,  All through the night  
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping,  Hill and dale in slumber sleeping  I my loved ones' watch am keeping,  All through the night  

While the moon her watch is keeping  All thro' the night;  
While the weary world is sleeping 
All thro' the night.  
O'er thy spirit gently stealing,  Visions of delight revealing,  Breathes a pure and holy feeling,  All thro' the night  

Angels watching ever round thee  All through the night  
In thy slumbers close surround thee  All through the night  
They will of all fears disarm thee,  No forebodings should alarm thee,  They will let no peril harm thee  All through the night.
