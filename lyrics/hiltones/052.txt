Love Is Spoken Here

I see my mother kneeling with our family each Day.  I hear the words she whispers as she bows her head to Pray.  Her plea to the Father quiets all my fears,  
And I am thankful love is spoken here.  

Mine is a home where ev'ry hour is blessed by  The strength of priesthood pow'r,  
With father and mother leading the way,  
Teaching me how to trust and obey;  
And the things they teach are crystal clear,  
For love is spoken here.  

I can often feel the Savior near  
When love is spoken here.
