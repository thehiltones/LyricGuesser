        "I see my mother kneeling with our family each Day.\u00a0 I hear the words she whispers as she bows her head to Pray.\u00a0 Her plea to the Father quiets all my fears,",
        "And I am thankful love is spoken here.",
        "",
        "Mine is a home where ev'ry hour is blessed by\u00a0 The strength of priesthood pow'r,",
        "With father and mother leading the way,",
        "Teaching me how to trust and obey;",
        "And the things they teach are crystal clear,",
        "For love is spoken here.",
        "",
        "I can often feel the Savior near",
        "When love is spoken here."
