McNamara’s Band  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE4clSqRlZs&list=PLL1_UHbUZR_xXBr2EBs9IOfygINJGnoMB&index=56
Oh me name is McNamara I'm the leader of the band.  Although we're few in number we're the finest in the land.  We play at wakes and weddin's and at every fancy ball  And when we play the funerals we play the best of all.  
CHORUS:  
Oh the drums go bang and the cymbals clang  And the horns they blaze away.  
McArthey pumps the old bassoon while  
I the pipes do play.  
And hennessey Tennessey tootles the flute  
And the music is something grand.  
A credit to old Ireland is McNamara's band.  

Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair.  The annual celebration all the gentry will be there.  
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the  hand.  
Said he, "I never saw the likes of McNamara's band." 
CHORUS  
Oh me name is uncle Julius and from  Sweden I did come.  
To play with McNamara's band and beat  the big base drum.
And when I march along the street the  ladies think I'm grand.  
They shout there's uncle Julius playing  and with an Irish band.  

Oh I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a  uniform of green.  
And I am the funniest looking Swede  that you have ever seen.  
Dennis of France, Aleance, Sheance,  and Meance they come from Ireland.  But by jimminy I am the only Swede in  McNamara's band.
