The Battle of New Orleans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXfuQqkwa5I&list=PLL1_UHbUZR_xXBr2EBs9IOfygINJGnoMB&index=76
In 1814 we took a little trip

Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,
And we caught the bloody British
in the town of New Orleans.
CHORUS
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
We looked down the river and we see the British come,
Man there must have been a hun'red
of 'em beating on the drum.

They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring,
We stood beside our cotton fields
and didn't say a thing.
CHORUS
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets 'til we
looked 'em in the eyes,
We held our fire 'til we see'd their faces well,
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
and really gave 'em well.
CHORUS
Ya, they ran thru the briars and they
ran thru the brambles,
And they ran thru the bushes where a
rabbit couldn't go,
They ran so fast that the hounds
couldn't catch 'em,

Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down,
So we grabbed an alligator and
we fought another round,
We filled his head with cannon balls
and powered his behind,
And when we touched the powder off
the 'gator lost his mind.
CHORUS
Ya, they ran thru the briars and they
ran thru the brambles,
And they ran thru the bushes where a
rabbit couldn't go,
They ran so fast that the hounds
couldn't catch 'em,
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
