Down in The Valley

Down in the valley, the valley so low, Hang your head over; hear the wind blow  Hear the wind blow, dear; hear the wind blow. Hang your head over; hear the wind blow. 

Roses love sunshine; violets love dew; Angels in heaven know I love you, Know I love you, dear, know I love you. Angels in heaven, know I love you! 

Build me a castle forty feet high. 
So, I may see her as she goes by. 
As she goes by, dear, as she goes by, So, I may see her, as she goes by.
