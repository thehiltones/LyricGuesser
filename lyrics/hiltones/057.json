        "Oh me name is McNamara I'm the leader of the band.\u00a0 Although we're few in number we're the finest in the land.\u00a0 We play at wakes and weddin's and at every fancy ball\u00a0 And when we play the funerals we play the best of all.",
        "CHORUS:",
        "Oh the drums go bang and the cymbals clang\u00a0 And the horns they blaze away.",
        "McArthey pumps the old bassoon while",
        "I the pipes do play.",
        "And hennessey Tennessey tootles the flute",
        "And the music is something grand.",
        "A credit to old Ireland is McNamara's band.",
        "",
        "Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair.\u00a0 The annual celebration all the gentry will be there.",
        "When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the\u00a0 hand.",
        "Said he, \"I never saw the likes of McNamara's band.\"",
        "CHORUS",
        "Oh me name is uncle Julius and from\u00a0 Sweden I did come.",
        "To play with McNamara's band and beat\u00a0 the big base drum.",
        "And when I march along the street the\u00a0 ladies think I'm grand.",
        "They shout there's uncle Julius playing\u00a0 and with an Irish band.",
        "",
        "Oh I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a\u00a0 uniform of green.",
        "And I am the funniest looking Swede\u00a0 that you have ever seen.",
        "Dennis of France, Aleance, Sheance,\u00a0 and Meance they come from Ireland.\u00a0 But by jimminy I am the only Swede in\u00a0 McNamara's band."
