All the animals down in Texas, Were sad as they could be, 
'Cause, Christmas day was on its way; And they had no Christmas Tree. 

But the prairie had lots of cactus, So, the gopher said, said he, 
"Fer Christmas sake, why don't we make A Cactus 
Christmas Tree?" 

The antelope put the tinsel on, 
The fireflies made it bright; 
The chickadees put a star upon The nicest tree in sight. 

When Santa Claus came a callin', Oh, he ho-ho-ho'd with glee 
And put their presents underneath, THE CACTUS CHRISTMAS TREE. 

Baby beaver, baby fox 
Got some baby building blocks; Nanny goat and Teddy bear,
Got some baby underwear. 

Each animal in sight, 
Got packages that night. 
When they woke up Christmas morning, How they ho-ho-ho'd with glee; To see their presents underneath, THE CAC-TUS CHRIST-MAS TREE.
