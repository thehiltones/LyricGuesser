        "On the banks of the river",
        "Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave.",
        "On the other side of the river",
        "Stood a lovely Indian maid.",
        "Little White Dove was her name",
        "Such a lovely sight to see.",
        "But the tribes fought with each other",
        "So their love could never be.",
        "CHORUS",
        "Running Bear, loved Little White Dove",
        "With a love big as the sky.",
        "Running Bear, loved Little White Dove",
        "With a love that couldn't die.",
        "",
        "He couldn't swim the raging river",
        "'Cause the river was too wide.",
        "He couldn't reach his Little White Dove",
        "Waiting on the other side.",
        "In the moonlight he could see her",
        "Throwing kisses across the waves.",
        "Her little heart was beating faster,",
        "Waiting there for her brave.",
        "CHORUS",
        "Running Bear dove in the water",
        "And Little White Dove did the same.",
        "And they swam up to each other,",
        "Through the swirling stream they came.",
        "As their hands touched and their lips met",
        "The raging river pulled them down.",
        "Now they'll always be together",
        "In that happy hunting ground."
