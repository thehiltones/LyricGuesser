I’ve Been Working on the Railroad

I've been working on the railroad 
All the livelong day. 
I've been working on the railroad 
Just to pass the time away. 
Can't you hear the whistle blowing Rise up so early in the morn 
Can't you hear the captain shouting "Dinah, blow your horn." 

Dinah won't you blow, 
Dinah won't you blow, 
Dinah won't you blow your horn. 
Dinah won't you blow, 
Dinah won't you blow, 
Dinah won't you blow your horn. 

Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah Someone's in the kitchen I know 
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah Strumming on the old banjo 

And singing: 
Fe, Fi, Fiddle-ee-i--oh 
Fe Fi Fiddle-ee-i-oh oh oh oh, 
Fe Fi Fiddle-ee-i-oh 
Strumming on the old banjo.
