Jesus wants me for a sunbeam,  
To shine for him each day;  
In ev'ry way try to please him,  
At home, at school, at play.  
CHORUS  
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,  
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam.  
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,  
I'll be a sunbeam for him  

Jesus wants me to be loving  
And kind to all I see,  
Showing how pleasant and happy  His little one can be.  
CHORUS
