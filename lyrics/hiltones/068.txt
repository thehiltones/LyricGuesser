Sipping Cider

One day I saw the cutest boy
A sippin' cider through a straw.

I asked him if he'd show me how
To sip cider through a straw...

He said of course he'd show me how
To sip my cider through a straw...

Then cheek to cheek and jaw to jaw
We sipped our cider through a straw...

Then suddenly the straw did slip
And we sipped cider lip to lip...

And now I have a Mother-in-law
And fourteen kids that call me Ma.

The moral of this story is
Don't you sip cider through a straw.
