Hail the day that sees Him rise, Alleluia!
To His throne beyond the skies. Alleluia!
Christ, the Lamb for sinners giv’n, Alleluia!
Enters now the highest heav’n. Alleluia!

There for Him high triumph waits. Alleluia!
Lift your heads, eternal gates. Alleluia!
He has conquered death and sin; Alleluia!
Take the King of Glory in. Alleluia!

See, He lifts His hands above! Alleluia!
See, He shows the prints of love! Alleluia!
Hark! His gracious gifts bestow, Alleluia!
Blessings on His Church below. Alleluia!

Lord, beyond our mortal sight, Alleluia!
Raise our hearts to reach Thy height. Alleluia!
There Thy face unclouded see, Alleluia!
Find our heav’n of heav’ns in Thee. Alleluia!
