In the Garden, Jesus suffered
Ev’ry sin and ev’ry woe—
Bleeding drops from ev’ry pore,
That we might forgiveness know.

Bread of Life, Living Water,
Feed my soul, fill my heart.
Lord, give me new life in Thee
And make me whole— complete and holy—
Bound to Thee eternally.

Jesus sacrificed His body
On the cross in bitter pain—
Freely gave His life for us
So that we would live again.

Bread of Life, Living Water,
Feed my soul, fill my heart.
Lord, give me new life in Thee
And make me whole— complete and holy—
Bound to Thee eternally.

Now I come before the altar,
Off’ring Him my broken heart,
Seeking for the precious gifts
His Atonement can impart.

Bread of Life, Living Water,
Feed my soul, fill my heart.
Lord, give me new life in Thee
And make me whole— complete and holy—
Bound to Thee eternally.
