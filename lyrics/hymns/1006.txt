Think a Sacred Song

Think a sacred song; the words will give you powâ€™r.
Think the melody, and in that very hour
Your heart and mind will open to let the Spirit in,
And you will feel His comfort again.

Think a sacred song when scared or feeling bad.
Hum the quiet tune whenever you are sad.
Your heart and mind will open to let the Spirit in,
And you will feel His comfort again.
