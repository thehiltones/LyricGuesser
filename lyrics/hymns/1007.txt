As Bread Is Broken

As bread is broken, we think of Thee—
Thy broken body on Calvary.
May we remember Thy suff’ring sore,
With broken hearts Thy grace implore.

We drink the water in memory
Of blood Thou spilt in Gethsemane.
Lord, wilt Thou wash us from ev’ry stain—
Our hearts and hands make clean again.

May our repentance now be sincere.
Unto our pleadings incline Thine ear.
We seek forgiveness— that gift divine—
A change of heart, a change of mind.

Help us, dear Savior, to take Thy name,
To be like Thee and Thy word proclaim.
Send us Thy Spirit this Sabbath day
To guide us in Thy holy way.
