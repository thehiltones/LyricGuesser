He is born, the divine Christ child;
Raise your voices in joyful melody!
He is born, the divine Christ child—
Sing of Jesus, the Baby mild.

Through the ages, prophets told
Of a long-awaited Savior.
Through the ages, prophets told
Of this Child we now behold.

He is born, the divine Christ child;
Raise your voices in joyful melody!
He is born, the divine Christ child—
Sing of Jesus, the Baby mild.

In a humble bed of hay,
How the Baby sweetly slumbers!
In a humble bed of hay
Sleeps our Heav’nly King today.

He is born, the divine Christ child;
Raise your voices in joyful melody!
He is born, the divine Christ child—
Sing of Jesus, the Baby mild.

Child of beauty! Child of grace!
Pure and perfect, Infant holy.
Child of beauty! Child of grace!
Heaven lights His holy face.

He is born, the divine Christ child;
Raise your voices in joyful melody!
He is born, the divine Christ child—
Sing of Jesus, the Baby mild.
