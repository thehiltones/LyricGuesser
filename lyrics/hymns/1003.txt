It Is Well with My Soul

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll—
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
“It is well, it is well with my soul.”

It is well with my soul;
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control:
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

It is well with my soul;
It is well, it is well with my soul.

My sin— oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!—
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more.
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.

It is well with my soul;
It is well, it is well with my soul.

O Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The heav’ns be rolled back like a scroll.
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend;
Even so, it is well with my soul.

It is well with my soul;
It is well, it is well with my soul.
